1. I used bootstrap
2. I used a CDN, it felt easiest and less complex for me.
3. HTML5 allows changes the web by making the design aspect of a page much more versatile. The canvas tag is a very cool feature that allows shapes, colors, and lines to be created directly on the page via js.
4. I had a busy week of homework and struggled for a while figuring out how to implement the Bootstrap correctly. Turns out I was just a step away for quite some time.
