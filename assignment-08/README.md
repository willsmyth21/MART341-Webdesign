1. The class attribute is used to group similar elements together for easier styling. The class can identify more than one element. A div element groups a number of elements together within itself.

Many of these can be placed within a div.
2. Using a host like YouTube or Vimeo to host videos can save on storage by linking the video. Self-Hosting videos can be too big and lag the site and even cost extra. Some disadvantages could be that the host sites like YouTube or Vimeo could crash, or the video could be deleted causing the video to not appear on the site.
