1. The universal selector is used with a star (*), it styles everything on the page
The element selector is used to select elements of a certain type, it would specify everything of h1 if that element was selected.
The class selector helps group elements to all fall under the same style. I find this the easiest way to construct a consisted and clean design across a web page with minimal work.
The Id selector is very similar to the class selector but can become slightly more specific.
2. To me the 2000s is a very warm color tone, this may be just because my favorite color was orange growing up. I chose dark and vibrant red to go together to get the tackiness feeling of 2000s design and the orange and light pink to show the innocence of the time period. I used all color styles to see what I liked best, I found I liked the rgb style the most because it is easiest to think up a color in my head and reach that specific color that I want. My dark red was #87141F, my vibrant red was solid red, my background orange was #DD6F3B, my pink was rgba(255, 15, 192, 0.5), the dotted borders are black, and all the text is white.
3. I had a busy week and required a lot of time management on my end. I was able to spend time with friends on St. Pattys day but also had several midterms, interviews, and assignments throughout the week. I was able to get everything done by Thursday in time to head to Utah for lacrosse game on Friday.
