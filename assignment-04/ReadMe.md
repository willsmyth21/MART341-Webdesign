1. Browsers work by processing codes such as HTML or CSS with a rendering machine to present an interactive display that we can use. A browser I primarily use is Google Chrome but occasionally will also use Safari.

2. A markup language is code of tags that are easily recognized to format text to the display. Using <p></p> is an example to create a paragraph using markup language
