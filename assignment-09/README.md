1. I have enjoyed learning the basics of HTML and its layout properties. I have always been very inspired by early 2000 art like blogs such as SCREENFULL and even dreamed of creating my own. With taking intro coding last semester a lot of this was fairly simple for me but helped put in better perspective of its actual uses. It is difficult to remember everything right away, I often have to look pieces up but I am memorizing more and more each week.
2. CSS for sure makes me a bit anxious. I like the creativity and how it can really simplify things, but it can feel like a lot of moving parts and get out of control at times. I am excited to take styling to a new level and learn some new aspects of that.
3. I had a great week enjoying the weather and stayed up on all of my schoolwork. I even got to go to Boise Idaho for two lacrosse games this weekend where I played really well and had a lot of fun. The downside of that is that a teammate tested positive sending me into yet another self quarantine until I can get tested again. Been pretty frustrated today knowing I'll go another week not hanging with friends due to a teammates stupid life choices. Maybe I will create a bunch of wack graphic art and throw it on a blog like its 2001 with all of my time!
