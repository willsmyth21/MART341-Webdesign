1. I learned a ton about web development, there is a lot of organization and extreme importance in clear file naming that I quickly learned. The use of repositories is a really interesting yet very daunting aspect of web development.
2. I learned even more about web design. I have always been very interested in web design and how it can be used in different ways. Through media arts I learned a lot about color, fonts, and layout through design work. Typically I was using these in creative aspects so I really enjoyed using these design tactics in practical ways for web design. For this project I tried to think of a way to go back to a creative aspect of web design that I have always been interested in. Through experiemtnation with mobile friendly resizing I figured out a (very basic) way to create a compositon of .jpgs, .pngs, and .gifs, that overlay in different ways but seperate into a cleaner format when resized differently. I hope to continue practing creative web design and maybe even end up with my own domain one day.
3. A major challenge I had with this was that Atom would not work properly, not sure what was going on but after wasting too much time trying to fix it I just used Visual Studio instead.
