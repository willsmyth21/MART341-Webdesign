I visited YouTube, I have always been interested in YouTube's history and wanted to get a better insight on what this entailed.
It basically looked like a blog of videos with a square thumbnail, very similar to how it is today. It has stayed relatively the same in terms of the general layout of things except it has become much more aesthetically pleasing and user friendly.

I have been able to learn a lot about the basic outline of building a website. I find it very interesting how nearly every action can be done with just a few letters and symbols together. It was really cool to inspect different websites I have visited and see how complex they really were. It can be difficult to memorize all the different formats and such without looking back at my notes but that is coming with practice.
