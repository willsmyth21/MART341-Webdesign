A document only requires there to be one <head> and one <body> per page. The head contains everything that is needed to give the page identity and display information about the site. It is where metadata is placed. The body features what one can physically see on the web page, headers, lists, links, etc..

Structural markup gives headings, paragraphs, breaks, lists. These are things that give the page a little more structure and allow the viewer to have an easier experience in viewing.
Semantic markup places emphasis on pieces within the page. For example it can some text in a paragraph bold or italic. \

This week I had challenges in time management, I procrastinated and pushed things back until the due date. I like to have the time to go through and interact with every additional link among the lessons on the website. However this week I did not quite have the time. In a way I was able to overcome it in that I was able to get up early and finish most of my homework with time to go back and look a little closer at the lesson along with have extra time to get out and ski!
