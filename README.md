This week I started lacrosse practice, was quite cold each night and was very sore but it all went well. I also spent a lot of time cooking for my roomates. This is something that is very new to me but and is certainly a challenge but I have really been enjoying it, and so are my roomates. I hope to keep this going through the next few weeks and learn new foods make. I would consider this to be both a challenge and success!
